# Defining Core Features

### Identifying the Assistant's Primary Function

This is the first step towards the prohect, where the goal is to determine the assistant's function, which is to help teams with scouting and recruiting players.
Some features that could be added, but not limited to, are:
- <b>Player Scouting:</b> Fetching and displaying stats for specific players (e.g., K/D ratio, agent usage).
- <b>Team Composition Suggestions:</b> Recommending team compositions based on player stats or preferences.
- <b>Answering Questions:</b> Providing general information about players, agents, or teams in the esports scene.

### Listing Core Features based on goals

Breaking down the assistant’s capabilities into smaller tasks that align with the project’s overall purpose:
- <b>Player Information Retrieval:</b> Pull data on specific players from Riot’s database (or an approved community source).
- <b>Team Composition Suggestions:</b> Use data-driven insights to recommend optimal team setups.
- <b>Answering Queries:</b> Respond to general or detailed questions about teams, players, agents, etc.
- <b>Performance Comparison:</b> Allow the assistant to compare stats between players.

### Outline User Interactions

Thinking about how the users would interact with the assistant and what kinds of questions or command will be asked. Rule out all the inappropriate questions and warn the user.
Some example questions would be:
- "Show me player stats for TenZ."
- "Recommend a team composition with Jett and Omen."
- "Who has the best win rate with Reyna in NA?"

### Prioritizing Features

Decide which features are essential for the first version of the project and which can be added later.

<b>Must Haves</b>:
- Player stats retrival

<b>Optional Features</b>:

- Contextual answers (e.g., “Who is the top duelist in the last tournament?”).
