Submissions to the Hackathon must meet the following requirements:

- Include a Project built with the required developer tools and meets the above Project Requirements.
- Include a text description that should explain the features, functionality, and methodology of your Project.
- Methodology write up should include a short explanation of how the model was trained and any notes about the methodology underlying team composition outputs. Include information about any other data sources used, and your findings and learnings as you worked through the project.
- Provide testing instructions for judges to test the Project’s results.
- Provide a URL to your code repository of the Project.
    - We encourage private code repositories.
    - Please provide access by sharing it with testing@devpost.com, riot-esports-hackathon-rg@riotgames.com, aws-riotgames-hackathons@amazon.com
- Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the Submission:
    - should be less than three (3) minutes. Judges are not required to watch beyond three minutes,
    - should include footage that shows the Project functioning on the device for which it was built,
    - must be uploaded to and made publicly visible on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku, and a link to the video must be provided on the submission form on the Hackathon Website; and
    - must not include third party trademarks, or copyrighted music or other material unless the Entrant has permission to use such material.
- Include an explanation of AWS services and data used to build the project.
- Optional: Provide a public URL to your working app.
- Optional Tagging: The AWS platform enables you to assign custom tags to your resources. A tag is a key-value pair applied to a resource to hold metadata about that resource. Each tag is a label consisting of a key and an optional value. Not all services and resource types currently support tags (see Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API). We recommend that any infrastructure you launch be tagged with “key: vct-hackathon value: 2024”.
