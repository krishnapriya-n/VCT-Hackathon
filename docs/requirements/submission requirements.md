# Submission Requirements

Submissions to the Hackathon must meet the following requirements:

- Include a Project built with the required developer tools and meets the above Project Requirements.
- Include a text description that should explain the features, functionality, and methodology of your Project.
- Methodology write up should include a short explanation of how the model was trained and any notes about the methodology underlying team composition outputs. Include information about any other data sources used, and your findings and learnings as you worked through the project.
- Provide testing instructions for judges to test the Project’s results.
- Provide a URL to your code repository of the Project.
    - We encourage private code repositories.
    - Please provide access by sharing it with testing@devpost.com, riot-esports-hackathon-rg@riotgames.com, aws-riotgames-hackathons@amazon.com
- Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the Submission:
    - should be less than three (3) minutes. Judges are not required to watch beyond three minutes,
    - should include footage that shows the Project functioning on the device for which it was built,
    - must be uploaded to and made publicly visible on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku, and a link to the video must be provided on the submission form on the Hackathon Website; and
    - must not include third party trademarks, or copyrighted music or other material unless the Entrant has permission to use such material.
- Include an explanation of AWS services and data used to build the project.
- Optional: Provide a public URL to your working app.
- Optional Tagging: The AWS platform enables you to assign custom tags to your resources. A tag is a key-value pair applied to a resource to hold metadata about that resource. Each tag is a label consisting of a key and an optional value. Not all services and resource types currently support tags (see Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API). We recommend that any infrastructure you launch be tagged with “key: vct-hackathon value: 2024”.

### Submission Ownership
Be the original work of the Entrant, be solely owned by the Entrant, and not violate the IP rights of any other person or entity.

### Public Distribution
The Entrant may make the Project available to the public via a website or online store but is not required to do so. 

### Testing
Access must be provided to an Entrant’s working Project for judging and testing by providing a link to a website, functioning demo, or a test build. If Entrant’s website is private, Entrant must include login credentials in its testing instructions. The Entrant must make the Project available free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the Sponsor, Administrator and Judges until the Judging Period ends. Judges are not required to test the Project and may choose to judge based solely on the text description, images, and video provided in the Submission.

Access can be provided to the Sponsor and Administrator by: testing@devpost.com, riot-esports-hackathon-rg@riotgames.com, and aws-riotgames-hackathons@amazon.com

If the Project includes software that runs on proprietary or third party hardware that is not widely available to the public, including software running on devices or wearable technology other than smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers, the Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to require the Entrant to provide physical access to the Project hardware upon request.  

### Team Representation
If a team or organization is entering the Hackathon, they must appoint and authorize one individual (the “Representative”) to represent, act, and enter a Submission, on their behalf. The Representative must meet the eligibility requirements above. By entering a Submission on the Hackathon Website on behalf of a team or organization you represent and warrant that you are the Representative authorized to act on behalf of your team or organization.
